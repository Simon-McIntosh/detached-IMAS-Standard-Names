    Number of elapsed seconds. Typically this expresses the number of
    seconds since the start of the pulse.

    Poloidal flux. Integral of magnetic field passing through a contour
    defined by the intersection of a flux surface passing through the point
    of interest and a $Z=\mathrm{constant}$ plane. The surface normal is in
    the same direction as increasing
    [`vertical_distance`](#vertical_distance).

    $$
    \psi_{pol} = \oint_S \textbf{B} \cdot d\textbf{S}

    ![Example surface to calculate poloidal flux.](img/poloidal_flux.png)

    Illustration of an integration surface (blue) to calculate the poloidal
    flux and the flux surface (grey). By definition, all points on the flux
    surface have the same value for the poloidal flux.
